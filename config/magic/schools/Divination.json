The eye can look in every direction.\nAs an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction.  There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can't enter another plane of existence.  A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter."

The DM chooses from the following possible omens:\n\t*Weal (for good results)\n\t*Woe (for bad results)\n\t*Weal and Woe (both good and bad results)\n\t*Nothing (for results that aren't especially good or bad)\nThe spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading.  The DM makes this roll in secret."
