unopposed check is just success roll (usually d20) under ability score

combat mechanic (opposed check):
  no initiative, no damage dice
  attack roll based on weapon size, effort, magic strength, etc
    unarmed d4
    dagger d6
    arrow/bolt d8
    axe/mace/sword d12
    2h weapon d20

    no upper bound, but success bounded by ability--you can roll too high
    except magic, which always does its damage, but the margin of oversuccess you take as penalty
  natural armor or worn armor as base armor
    or magic resistance by type (which can be negative, eg metal armor and electricity)
  add shield, dex, etc
  if attack is <= armor it does no damage
  if > armor and <= armor + shield/dex:
    if dex, dodged
    if shield, blocked
  once, shield can be used to negate any physical blow, destroying it
  armor can also take HP loss but loses armor per point of physical damage
    clothing 1
    leather 3
    chain 5
    plate 7
    shield 2
  evaluate in ascending order of attack roll
    lowest successes go first, meaning low defense dies first
    big damage pools like AoE spells go last
